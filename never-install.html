</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I used to be a Windows person. Windows was my preferred operating system.
Mac had no appeal and Linux was too technical.</p>
<p>How opinions change! Now I predominantly use OS X and am very comfortable in
Linux, both on the command line and in a GUI.</p>
<p>One trick I learned while using Windows was that installing applications causes
slowdowns.
I believe on Windows that this was mostly due to the bulk added to the Windows
registry.
So I usually looked for programs that I did not have to install.
Some of my favorites are Eclipse and SciTE.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this aversion to installing things has stuck with me.
When I write Python code I want packages that are standalone and can be dropped
into the Python path and just work.
For the most part I find that this is possible.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I do not fret over things like database bindings that require code to be compiled.</p>
<p>My quirkiness aside, standalone applications work better in the long run.
Consider OS X, each app is installed by copying it to the Applications folder.
Uninstalling is as simple as dragging it to the trash.
OS X does not slow down as you install and uninstall programs.
Installing is easy and no fuss. Uninstalling is also easy and no fuss.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people do not hold to my perspective.
Many packages I would use turn out to require lots of config just to get them
up and running.</p>
<p>It appears to me that all of these collections of small tools that make up the
final product are like a deck of cards stacked into a castle.
One card gets bumped and the whole castle falls down.</p>
<p>When we do have to build such a stack of cards are there ways to keep it from
collapsing?
Does anyone have suggestions for reducing both effort and setup time?</p>
