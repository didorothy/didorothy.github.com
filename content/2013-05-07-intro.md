I am hoping to store my travels in programming and information technology here.
I have found that random bits of knowledge are discovered every week and yet I
never take the time to record much of it. This is my attempt to capture that
fleeting insight.

So look forward to some Python, Django, JavaScript and others to show up here.
Here will also likely be a spattering of some IT related info as well.

So whether you find my posts to be as the title implies worthless knowledge or
as truly valuable insight, enjoy.
