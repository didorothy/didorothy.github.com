I always thought that the biggest problem I would have with shipping would be
with poorly documented APIs.
However, recently I learned that shipping and addressing could be a struggle.

I have written integrations for postal services in the past and have had little
issue.
Familiarity enables us to understand more quickly.
Who in the US has not had any experience with the US Postal Service?

I have never been to Australia nor had any previous experience with AUPost.
Writing an integration was more difficult because of the lack of familiarity.
I kept trying to relate AU shipping to my understanding of US shipping only to
bring me to frustration.

When I finally studied how shipping works in Australia I began to make progress.
I found that an integration was really not much different there than the integration with US shippers.

My real difficulty began when I found out that the Australian site needed to accommodate New Zealand addresses.

Australia and the US both have states that can be abbreviated and are used in addressing.
New Zealand uses cities that are not abbreviated. To add to my confusion New Zealand also uses suburbs in addressing.

A suburb in New Zealand is a part of a city.
It is almost like a city within a city or perhaps like a neighborhood in the US but of a larger size.

At first approach, I started looking for city names as if they were states.
I found out that New Zealand has regions but none of them matched the city names.
Only by looking at the New Zealand Postal Service website revealed how the addresses work.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Did you discover any other ways to help you better understand an unfamiliar service's requirements?
