Title: My PayPal Perspective

PayPal offers a great service to individuals. Ease of making and receiving payment.
Low rates. Peace of mind.
Unfortunately, the developer side of things leaves much to be desired.

PayPal has some of the most extensive documentation around.
They have very detailed API documentation that indicates deprecated fields, when fields were added, and formatting or length requirements.
Their overview documents are great at showing you the big picture, how a user should flow from step to step.
How can you have a problem with them when they seem to be doing everything right?
If they have all this detailed and overview documentation integration should be a breeze.
Somehow this is not how it works out every time I write an integration.

So what is missing? I think that they are missing the middle ground.
They tell me the big picture and they tell me the minutia but they don't give me practical recommendations.
Tell me, "If you want your customer to see a simple one price value, use these fields in these services."
Tell me, "If you want your customer to see detailed order information, use these fields in these services."
Limit my options. "If you are doing a simple one price integration, you have the following additional options."
Try to push me into a particular direction. Tell me, "We recommend that you provide detailed order information in every integration."
Provide sample code or service calls for a preferred type of integration.

I do many integrations and I don't have time nor the desire to become a PayPal expert.
I don't have time to integrate every service they offer just to get to know their services better.
There are several dozen good payment processors and I need to be able to easily interact with whichever ones my clients or employer wants me to.

What are your thoughts on PayPal integrations?
Do you experience the same frustrations?
Do you think I am off base in my assessment?
